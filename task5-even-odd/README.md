### Programing by Dart
## Control Flow <br> Categorize a list of numbers into even or odd

### Description
This is a Dart program that categorizes a list of numbers into even or odd. The program demonstrates the use of lists, `for` loops, and `switch` statements to classify numbers effectively.

### How It Works
1. A list of numbers is predefined in the program.
2. The program iterates through the list using a `for` loop.
3. A `switch` statement is used to evaluate whether each number is even or odd.
4. The result (even or odd) is printed for each number.
