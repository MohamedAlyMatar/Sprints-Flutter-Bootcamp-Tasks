## Variables & Constants <br> Calculate the total cost of a grocery items

### Description
A simple Dart program that calculates the total cost of grocery items, including taxes. The program demonstrates the use of lists, maps, constants, and loops to perform calculations and produce results.

### How It Works
1. Each grocery item is stored as a map with its name and price.
2. A loop iterates through all items to sum up their prices.
3. The program calculates the tax amount based on a constant tax rate of 10%.
4. The total cost before and after tax is calculated and displayed.
