### Programing by Dart
## Control Flow <br> Check any number positive or negative and even or odd

### Description
This Dart program checks whether a given integer is positive, negative, or zero, and also determines if it is even or odd. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements and operators in Dart.

### How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer number.
2. The input is validated to ensure it is an integer.
3. The program uses conditions:
   - To check whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - To determine if it is even or odd using the modulus operator.
4. Outputs the results to the user.
